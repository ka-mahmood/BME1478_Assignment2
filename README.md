BME1478 Assignment 2 script & files are in this repository. All of the task scripts are run using the following, with the terminal in this directory:

`bash assignment2_script.sh`

The individual scripts for each task, up to 5, can be run using:

`bash task{#}.sh`

E.g., Task 1 is run with `bash task1.sh`.

The files currently in the directory are shown post-processing. Replace `./assignment-data` with the unprocessed information and re-run the script to test. 

The `assignment-data-copy` folder contains the original data. This is used for the comparison using `diff` for task 4. The explanation for using `diff` is included in the script output.
The `assignment-data-proper` folder contains the manually edited data to compare the post-processed data to.
