BME1478 Assignment 2 script & files are in this repository. All of the task scripts are run using the following, with the terminal in this directory:

`bash a2_run_subscripts.sh` or `bash a2_full_script.sh`. The former runs each subscript, while the latter contains all the code combined into one for easier submission.

The individual scripts for each task, up to 5, can be run using:

`bash task#.sh`

E.g., Task 1 is run with `bash task1.sh`.

The files currently in the directory are shown post-processing. Replace `assignment-data` with the unprocessed information (`assignment-data-original`) and re-run the script to test. 

The `assignment-data-original` folder contains the original data. This is used to overwrite the revised files made through running the command using `diff` for task 4. The explanation for using `diff` is included in the script output.

The `assignment-data-proper` folder contains the manually edited data to compare the post-processed data to. This is what is used for comparison in Task 4.
